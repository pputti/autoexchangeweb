  "category": "SUV",
  "details": "A coupe SUV is a type of sport utility vehicle with a sloping rear roofline similar to those of fastbacks or Kammbacks. The sloping roofline is adopted to offer a styling advantage compared to its standard SUV counterpart,[1][2] which helps increase profit margins as manufacturers are able to raise the price by marketing it as a more premium model.[3] Since all coupe SUVs ever produced are of the crossover variety, coupe SUVs may also be called \"coupe crossovers\" or \"coupe crossover SUVs\".",
